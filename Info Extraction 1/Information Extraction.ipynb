By Saurabh M Deshmukh \\xa0 |\\xa0Sumit Kaushik \\xa0Feb 6, 2024 9:36:25 AM IST (Updated)5 Min ReadThe recently unveiled Interim Union Budget for the fiscal year 2024–25 stands as a testament to the Government of India’s unwavering commitment to steering India towards economic prosperity and inclusive development. Beyond the numbers and allocations, it is a comprehensive roadmap that paints a picture of a resilient and vibrant India, ready to embrace opportunities and overcome challenges. Share Market LiveNSEView All  View All  It is a comprehensive and forward-looking document, underscoring the government's commitment to steering India through a trajectory of economic prosperity and inclusive development. One of the standout features of the budget is the substantial 11.1% increase in the capital expenditure outlay, reaching an impressive ₹11,11,111 crore, constituting 3.4% of the GDP. This announcement comes on the heels of a remarkable tripling of the capital expenditure outlay over the past four years, highlighting a strategic and calculated effort to spur economic growth and foster job creation.GDPThe economic indicators embedded in the budget are promising. With India's real GDP projected to grow at 7.3% in FY 2023–24, aligning with the RBI's revised growth projections, the country showcases resilience amidst global economic challenges. The International Monetary Fund's positive revision of growth projections for India further underscores the increasing global confidence in India's economic prowess.India's anticipated ascent to become the third-largest economy by 2027, coupled with its estimated contribution to global growth rising by 200 basis points in five years, positions the country as a key player on the global economic stage. Projections from various international agencies, including the World Bank, the IMF, OECD, and ADB, further solidify India's growth potential between 6.1% and 6.7% in 2024–25.GST CollectionBuoyed by robust economic activity, the budget notes a significant milestone—the seventh occasion where gross GST revenues crossed the benchmark of Rs 1.6 lakh crore, standing at ₹ 1.65 lakh crore in December 2023. This economic buoyancy is reflected positively on revenue collections and points towards strong growth momentum and formalisation in the economy.The budget's estimates for the fiscal year 2024–25 indicate a well-balanced approach, with total receipts other than borrowings and total expenditure estimated at ₹30.80 and ₹47.66 lakh crore, respectively. Tax receipts are anticipated to reach ₹26.02 lakh crore, showcasing a pragmatic fiscal framework.A notable announcement is the continuation of the fifty-year interest-free loan for capital expenditure to states, with a total outlay of ₹1.3 lakh crore. This move aligns with the government's vision of 'Viksit Bharat' and supports milestone-linked reforms by state governments.Fiscal Deficit While maintaining a fiscal consolidation path, the budget outlines a commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit below 4.5% by 2025–26, with the estimated fiscal deficit for 2024–25 at 5.1% of GDP. The gross and net market borrowings are estimated at ₹14.13 and ₹11.75 lakh crore, respectively, both lower than the previous fiscal year.The government's approach to development is laudable, transcending earlier models of 'provisioning up-to-village level' to a more comprehensive, all-encompassing paradigm. The focus on four major segments—'Garib' (poor), 'Mahilayen' (women), 'Yuva' (youth), and 'Annadata' (farmer)—indicates a commitment to addressing the diverse needs, aspirations, and welfare of the population.The Interim Budget recognises the pivotal role of women in nation-building, with initiatives like Mudra Yojana loans for women entrepreneurs, increased female enrollment in higher education, and significant representation in STEM courses. Momentum for 'Nari Shakti' is evident, reflecting a commitment to gender equality and women's empowerment.Social DevelopmentThe budget also emphasises social justice, highlighting the government's efforts to uplift the marginalised through schemes like PM-SVANidhi, PM-KISAN SAMMAN Yojana, and PM-JANMAN Yojana. It is heartening to see the focus on multi-dimensional poverty reduction and financial inclusion, with DBT of Rs 34 lakh crore using PM-Jan Dhan accounts leading to substantial savings for the government.The roadmap for 'Viksit Bharat' includes substantial provisions for agriculture and food processing, infrastructure development, railways, aviation, green energy initiatives, and tourism sector promotion. The commitment to attracting foreign investments, exemplified by the FDI inflow reaching USD 596 billion during 2014–23, underscores India's attractiveness as an investment destination.The Interim Union Budget for 2024–25 is not just a financial plan; it is a roadmap for a resilient, inclusive, and vibrant India. Every challenge is viewed as an opportunity, and the government's visionary approach sets the tone for a 'Kartavya Kaal'—a period of responsibility and commitment towards building a stronger, more prosperous India. As the country stands at the threshold of immense possibilities and opportunities, this budget heralds a new era of development with fresh inspirations, heightened consciousness, and new resolutions. The government's pledge to present a detailed roadmap for the pursuit of 'Viksit Bharat' in the upcoming full budget in July holds the promise of even greater achievements and milestones on the horizon. \\xa0—The authors: Saurabh M Deshmukh is Director Audit, Department of Post, Government of India; & Sumit Kaushik is\\xa0a social impact consultant.

Sitharaman showcased the government’s achievements over the past decade, rather than shower freebies, ahead of national polls due in a couple of months. A careful analysis shows the changing patterns in the Indian economy.\\nSitharaman reduced the food subsidy by 3.3 percent to 2.12 trillion rupees ($25.5bn) in 2025 from 2.05 trillion rupees ($24.6bn) in the current fiscal year. The fertiliser subsidy was also reduced while keeping up capital expenditure at 1.3 trillion rupees ($15.6bn).Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4‘Nothing left’: Indonesia’s tourism industry fears wipeout under tax hikelist 2 of 4‘Reputational damage’: Singapore’s ruling party grapples with scandallist 3 of 4US Senate unveils $118bn deal on border, aid for Israel and Ukrainelist 4 of 4Australian writer Yang Hengjun sentenced to death on China spy chargesend of list\\nKeeping such spending in check allowed her to announce that the fiscal deficit would be 5.1 percent for the year ending March 2025, lower than market expectations of about 5.3 to 5.4 percent.\\nThe “fiscal deficit was one of the most surprising things in the budget”, said Suman Bannerjee, the chief investment officer at Hedonova, a global hedge fund. “This was lower than we had expected.”\\nThe reduced subsidy also indicates India’s “move away from agriculture towards manufacturing”, Bannerjee said.\\nThe government had earlier announced free food supplies to India’s poorest, shielding them from potential food price rises.\\nIn her speech, Sitharaman said the average real income has risen by 50 percent, more than 250 million people have been lifted from poverty while the economy has catapulted to the world’s fifth-largest from the 10th in the last decade.\\nThese numbers were disputed by the opposition Congress party.\\n“COVID and this government’s GST [goods and services tax] have dealt a double blow to the country’s poor and small businesses, which this government has not addressed,” said Manickam Tagore, a Congress member of parliament and party whip.\\nDemand for the country’s Food for Work programme had grown just in the last year, indicating distress among the country’s poorest, he said.\\nIn her speech, Sitharaman said the lower fiscal deficit was also enabled by growing private investment.\\n“We had looked at whether private sector capital expenditure is reviving and some green shoots are being seen,” said Sunil Sinha, the principal economist at Fitch Ratings. “There is not yet a broad-based corporate investment revival but investment in steel, cement, renewables and other sectors are growing due to increased government investment in infrastructure.”\\nThe government’s improved tax collection may also have helped reduce the fiscal deficit, Bannerjee said. Higher tax realisation had come by increasing the ambit of luxury tax, such as including restaurant spending.\\nWhile India’s economy is expected to grow at a robust 7.3 percent in the year ended March 2024, there is concern that it is urban-centric [Manish Swarup/AP]\\nAll of this allowed the finance minister to keep to her capital expenditure allocations while keeping the fiscal deficit in check. India has been building public infrastructure such as roads, metros and ports at a record pace, driving economic growth. “She has not diluted her capex focus,” Fitch Ratings’s Sinha said.\\nRural India\\nThe finance minister also announced several schemes aimed at shoring up the rural economy such as for building rural housing, free food for the poor and boosting aquaculture.\\nWhile India’s economy is expected to grow at a robust 7.3 percent in the year ending March 2024, there is concern that it is urban-centric.\\n“She lives in an ivory tower. She doesn’t know the pain of the people,” the Congress Party’s Tagore said. “Across small towns, I see medium and small enterprises have closed due to the implementation of GST.”\\nThursday’s budget measures could help bring the benefits of urban growth to boost the rural economy. \\xa0“Some of these are like an indirect income transfer,” said Fitch’s Sinha. “So far, the benefits of growth are accruing to the top 50 percent in urban India. Some investment had to be done so benefits could reach rural areas.”\\nGender focus\\nThe finance minister also announced several initiatives to boost women’s skill-building and entrepreneurship, including the expansion of a scheme to train rural women on skills such as bulb-making and plumbing.\\nFemale participation in the rural workforce has been growing, although it is largely in agriculture. This is often marked by low wages and seasonal work. Acquiring such skills could help transition women to manufacturing jobs.\\n“Data shows that while [the] unemployment subsidy has fallen, female unemployment is down and male unemployment is up,” Hedonova’s Bannerjee said.\\nIndia has had low female participation in the workforce, with only 37 percent of women in formal employment in 2023. The finance minister said women’s enrolment in higher education, as well as STEM [science, technology, engineering and maths] courses, had risen sharply in the last decade.\\nIndia has been building public infrastructure such as roads, metros and ports at a record pace, driving economic growth [Rafiq Maqbool/AP Photo]\\nHowever, Raghuram Rajan, India’s former central bank governor, recently told the BBC that not enough attention had been paid to creating “human capital” in India.\\nSinha and Bannerjee underscored that detailed employment data had not been collected in the last decade. “We are flying blind without credible data on jobs,” Rajan had told the BBC.\\nRenewable energy\\nThe finance minister announced a household rooftop solar energy scheme that will allow 10 million households to claim 300 units of free energy a month. These households could also sell back the surplus energy they generate. She also announced an expansion in charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and viability gap funding for wind power projects.\\nIndia has announced a target of getting to net zero by 2070 and these schemes lay out a roadmap towards that.\\n“The southern states are largely self-sufficient; this will help the northern states where there is a deficit. It will also help develop wind energy, which has lagged other renewable energy,” Hedonova’s Bannerjee said.\\nSitharaman also set off the poll season by announcing a white paper to be tabled in parliament, which will look at where the country was until 2014, during the previous government, and where it is now, to draw lessons from the “mismanagement of those years”.\\nThe careful spending ahead of elections may indicate the government’s confidence. It won elections in three major states just weeks ago and Prime Minister Modi also inaugurated the Ram Temple at Ayodhya on January 22 to nationwide fanfare.\\nModi said the budget hit a “sweet spot” that made capital expenditure while maintaining fiscal discipline.\\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\\n\\n\""

The fertiliser subsidy was also reduced while keeping up capital expenditure at 1.3 trillion rupees ($15.6bn).Keep reading list of 4 itemslist 1 of 4‘Nothing left’: Indonesia’s tourism industry fears wipeout under tax hikelist 2 of 4‘Reputational damage’: Singapore’s ruling party grapples with scandallist 3 of 4US Senate unveils $118bn deal on border, aid for Israel and Ukrainelist 4 of 4Australian writer Yang Hengjun sentenced to death on China spy chargesend of listKeeping such spending in check allowed her to announce that the fiscal deficit would be 5.1 percent for the year ending March 2025, lower than market expectations of about 5.3 to 5.4 percent.The “fiscal deficit was one of the most surprising things in the budget”, said Suman Bannerjee, the chief investment officer at Hedonova, a global hedge fund. “This was lower than we had expected.”The reduced subsidy also indicates India’s “move away from agriculture towards manufacturing”, Bannerjee said.The government had earlier announced free food supplies to India’s poorest, shielding them from potential food price rises.In her speech, Sitharaman said the average real income has risen by 50 percent, more than 250 million people have been lifted from poverty while the economy has catapulted to the world’s fifth-largest from the 10th in the last decade.These numbers were disputed by the opposition Congress party.“COVID and this government’s GST [goods and services tax] have dealt a double blow to the country’s poor and small businesses, which this government has not addressed,” said Manickam Tagore, a Congress member of parliament and party whip.Demand for the country’s Food for Work programme had grown just in the last year, indicating distress among the country’s poorest, he said.In her speech, Sitharaman said the lower fiscal deficit was also enabled by growing private investment.“We had looked at whether private sector capital expenditure is reviving and some green shoots are being seen,” said Sunil Sinha, the principal economist at Fitch Ratings. “There is not yet a broad-based corporate investment revival but investment in steel, cement, renewables and other sectors are growing due to increased government investment in infrastructure.”The government’s improved tax collection may also have helped reduce the fiscal deficit, Bannerjee said. Higher tax realisation had come by increasing the ambit of luxury tax, such as including restaurant spending.While India’s economy is expected to grow at a robust 7.3 percent in the year ended March 2024, there is concern that it is urban-centric [Manish Swarup/AP]All of this allowed the finance minister to keep to her capital expenditure allocations while keeping the fiscal deficit in check. India has been building public infrastructure such as roads, metros and ports at a record pace, driving economic growth. “She has not diluted her capex focus,” Fitch Ratings’s Sinha said.Rural IndiaThe finance minister also announced several schemes aimed at shoring up the rural economy such as for building rural housing, free food for the poor and boosting aquaculture.While India’s economy is expected to grow at a robust 7.3 percent in the year ending March 2024, there is concern that it is urban-centric.“She lives in an ivory tower. She doesn’t know the pain of the people,” the Congress Party’s Tagore said. “Across small towns, I see medium and small enterprises have closed due to the implementation of GST.”Thursday’s budget measures could help bring the benefits of urban growth to boost the rural economy. \\xa0“Some of these are like an indirect income transfer,” said Fitch’s Sinha. “So far, the benefits of growth are accruing to the top 50 percent in urban India. Some investment had to be done so benefits could reach rural areas.”Gender focusThe finance minister also announced several initiatives to boost women’s skill-building and entrepreneurship, including the expansion of a scheme to train rural women on skills such as bulb-making and plumbing.Female participation in the rural workforce has been growing, although it is largely in agriculture. This is often marked by low wages and seasonal work. Acquiring such skills could help transition women to manufacturing jobs.“Data shows that while [the] unemployment subsidy has fallen, female unemployment is down and male unemployment is up,” Hedonova’s Bannerjee said.India has had low female participation in the workforce, with only 37 percent of women in formal employment in 2023. The finance minister said women’s enrolment in higher education, as well as STEM [science, technology, engineering and maths] courses, had risen sharply in the last decade.India has been building public infrastructure such as roads, metros and ports at a record pace, driving economic growth [Rafiq Maqbool/AP Photo]However, Raghuram Rajan, India’s former central bank governor, recently told the BBC that not enough attention had been paid to creating “human capital” in India.Sinha and Bannerjee underscored that detailed employment data had not been collected in the last decade. “We are flying blind without credible data on jobs,” Rajan had told the BBC.Renewable energyThe finance minister announced a household rooftop solar energy scheme that will allow 10 million households to claim 300 units of free energy a month. These households could also sell back the surplus energy they generate. She also announced an expansion in charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and viability gap funding for wind power projects.India has announced a target of getting to net zero by 2070 and these schemes lay out a roadmap towards that.“The southern states are largely self-sufficient; this will help the northern states where there is a deficit. It will also help develop wind energy, which has lagged other renewable energy,” Hedonova’s Bannerjee said.Sitharaman also set off the poll season by announcing a white paper to be tabled in parliament, which will look at where the country was until 2014, during the previous government, and where it is now, to draw lessons from the “mismanagement of those years”.The careful spending ahead of elections may indicate the government’s confidence. It won elections in three major states just weeks ago and Prime Minister Modi also inaugurated the Ram Temple at Ayodhya on January 22 to nationwide fanfare.Modi said the budget hit a “sweet spot” that made capital expenditure while maintaining fiscal discipline.Source: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\""
